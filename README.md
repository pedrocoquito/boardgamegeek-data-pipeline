# boardgamegeek-data-pipeline

Cloud data pipeline to analyze trends and patterns on BoardGameGeek website.
- The files `cluster.png` and `cluster.JSON` in the `docs/` folder contain information and evidence about the cluster configured in Databricks for achieving the project.

## Objective of the Project

**Problem to be Solved:**

Explore trends and patterns in board games to identify which factors contribute to a game's success and popularity on BoardGameGeek from 2001 to 2021.

**Business Questions:**

1. **What are the most popular and highly rated board games on BoardGameGeek?**

2. **Is there a correlation between game duration and its popularity or rating?**

3. **Is there a correlation between the recommended minimum age and a game's popularity?**

4. **What is the complexity of the most popular games?**

5. **How have the popularity and ratings of games changed over the years?**

6. **Which game Mechanics and Domains are the most popular and which have the best ratings?**

7. **Is there a correlation between popularity and a game's rating?**

8. **What is the relationship between the recommended number of players and a gameâ€™s popularity?**

## Data Collection

The data was collected by directly downloading the file from this link: [BoardGameGeek Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/melissamonfared/board-games). The dataset includes:

- **Data Source:** Downloaded from Kaggle.
- **Collection Technique:** Direct CSV download.
- **Transformations:** Data was adjusted to fit the Star Schema model, creating fact and dimension tables. 
- **Code:** The `modelingAndLoading.py` file in the `notebooks/` folder and its execution on Databricks link [Modeling and Loading Data](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/2574631733088421/3142486001784750/3650020472583597/latest.html) or see the `modelingAndLoading.png` screenshot in the `docs/` folder. 

## Data Analysis and Normalization

### Data Quality Analysis

- The file `dataAnalysis.py` in the `notebooks/` folder and its execution on Databricks can be found here: [Data Analysis](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/2574631733088421/3142486001784756/3650020472583597/latest.html) or the screenshot on `dataAnalysis.png` file in the `docs/` folder.

The script performed the following steps:

1. Check for null values:
    - No null values were found in the tables

2. Check for duplicate values:
    - No duplicate rows were found in the tables.

3. Perform a statistical analysis on numerical attributes to identify the minimum and maximum values:
    - `games_dimension` table:
        - `year_published` ranges from 2001 to 2021.
        - `min_players` ranges from 0 to 10.
        - `max_players` ranges from 1 to 999.
        - `play_time` ranges from 0 to 2250 minutes.
        - `min_age` ranges from 0 to 25 years.
    - `facts_table`:
        - `users_rated` ranges from 30 to 182214.
        - `rating_average` ranges from 1.1 to 97.0.
        - `complexity_average` ranges from 0.0 to 49.0.
        - `owned_users` ranges from 3 to 155312.

4. Group the mechanics and domains by their names and counts, ordering them by the count in descending order:
    - The most frequent mechanics and domains are listed, indicating the popularity of certain game mechanics and domains among the games.

### Data Normalization

- The file `dataNormalization.py` in the `notebooks/` folder and its execution on Databricks can be found at the link [Data Normalization](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/2574631733088421/3142486001784762/3650020472583597/latest.html) or the screenshot showing the execution on the platform in the file `dataNormalization.png` in the `docs/` folder.

The script performed the following steps:

1. Remove duplicates: Duplicate entries in the dataset are removed, keeping only the first occurrence.

2. Fix zero or negative values: For specific columns, values of 0 or less are replaced with a specified default value:
   - The columns `min_players`, `max_players`, and `complexity_average`: Set to 1 if the value is 0 or less.

3. Set Maximum Values: For specific columns, values exceeding a certain value are fixed:
   - `max_players` and `play_time`: Limited in 999.
   - `min_age`: Limited in 21.

4. Imput Missing Values: Values in the `min_age` and `play_time` columns are imputed with the median value of the column for games with similar complexity.
 
5. Standardizing floating numbers: Rounded to 2 decimal places and formatted to avoid leading zeros and using `.` as the decimal separator.
 
6. The corrected data has been saved in new tables (`games_dimension_normalized` and `facts_normalized`).

You can also see the `q1.png` through `q8.png` screenshots in the `docs/` folder.

## Results for Business Questions:

#### 1. What are the most popular and highly rated board games on BoardGameGeek?

- Screenshot `q1.png`.
- Pandemic is the most popular with 155312 owners and second place with 112410. User ratings fairly close among the top games (~7.6).

#### 2. Is there a correlation between game duration and its popularity or rating?

- Screenshot `q2.png`.
- Little to no correlation (0.02 result) between game duration and either popularity or rating.

#### 3. Is there a correlation between the recommended minimum age and a game's popularity?

- Screenshot `q3.png`.
- Minimum age has impact on game sales with a correlation of 0.09.

#### 4. What is the complexity of the most popular games?

- Screenshot `q4.png`.
- No strong correlation between a game's complexity and its sales values from 1.19 to 3.24.

#### 5. How have the popularity and ratings of games changed over the years?

- Screenshot `q5.png`.
- Popularity peaked between 2012 (1715345) and 2018 (1623136) with a peak in 2015 with 2198127 owners, while ratings were higher in 2020 (14.0) and 2021 (14.9).

#### 6. Which game Mechanics and Domains are the most popular and which have the best ratings?

- Screenshots `q6-Domains.png` and `q6-Mechanics.png`.
- "Hand Management" with 9163625 users is the most popular mechanic; While "Thematic Games" has the highest ratings with 13.5.

#### 7. Is there a correlation between popularity and a game's rating?

- Screenshot `q7.png`.
- No significant relationship (with 0.02) between the number of owners and game ratings.

#### 8. What is the relationship between the recommended number of players and a gameâ€™s popularity?

- Screenshot `q8.png`.
- No clear relationship between the recommended number of players and game popularity, since the minimum and maximum number of players varied a lot.

## Conclusion

The data shows that successful board games often have "Hand Management" mechanics and fit into the "Thematic Games" domain. They also tend to have low complexity and a low recommended minimum age.
